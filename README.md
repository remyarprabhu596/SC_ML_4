✋ Task 4 – Hand Gesture Recognition Using Machine Learning

This project was completed as part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The goal was to build a machine learning model that can recognize and classify different hand gestures from images using traditional ML techniques.

📁 Dataset

The dataset used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle:  
🔗https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritikagiridhar/2000-hand-gestures

It contains image samples of various hand gestures captured in different lighting and orientations.

📌 Objectives

- Preprocess hand gesture images using OpenCV
- Extract meaningful features from images using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
- Train a classifier using SVM for multi-class classification
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV – for reading and processing images
- NumPy – for numerical operations
- Scikit-learn – for feature scaling, model training, and evaluation
- Matplotlib – for visualizations
- HOG (from skimage or OpenCV)

   📊 Key Learnings

- How to handle real-world image data in traditional ML
- Feature extraction using **HOG** instead of deep learning
- Applying **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for image classification
- Evaluating models using confusion matrix and classification reports

✅ Output

- Multi-class hand gesture classifier using SVM  
- Accuracy and performance metrics displayed through visualizations  
- Real-time application potential in gesture-based control systems
